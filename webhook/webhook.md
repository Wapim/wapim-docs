# Webhook

A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page), or web application, with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application. \([**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook)\)

You can setup webhook configuration on [**app.wapim.io**](https://app.wapim.io).  
  
There are two things you need to do. 

1. Define POST URL for Webhooks.
2. Choose what you want to be informed about.
