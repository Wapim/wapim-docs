# Before you start

## What do I need to use the API?

All you need is to provide an  Wapim API token. You can provide a new token [here](https://app.wapim.io).

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
